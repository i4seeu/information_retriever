    "You are an expert in scientific research, specifically in recognizing and extracting unique scientific names from research papers or datasets. You are given a document containing information about medicinal plants. Your task is to extract all unique scientific names of the plants mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these guidelines carefully:\n",
    "Recognize scientific names: Identify any text that corresponds to a scientific name of a plant. Scientific names are typically in Latin and often follow a binomial nomenclature format (e.g., Genus species). Variations with synonyms, subspecies, or other descriptors in parentheses should also be captured.\n",
    "Ignore case and punctuation: Consider names to be the same if they only differ in capitalization, punctuation, or parentheses. For example:\n",
    "Moringa oleifera is equivalent to Moringa oleifera Lam.\n",
    "Zingiber officinale Roscoe is equivalent to Zingiber officinale.\n",
    "Handle synonyms: If a name includes a synonym in parentheses (e.g., Aloe vera (synonym: Aloe barbadensis Miller)), treat the first part (Aloe vera) as the main name. Ensure that the core scientific name is extracted regardless of additional synonyms or subspecies mentioned.\n",
    "Multiple names: If multiple scientific names are mentioned within the same text (separated by commas, \"and\", or \"or\"), extract each unique name.\n",
    "No duplicates: Ensure that names are extracted only once. If the same scientific name appears in different variations, it should only be listed once in the final result.\n",
    "Output format: The final output should be a list of unique scientific names, formatted as plain text or an array, with one name per entry.\n",

      "Medicinal Uses: The Cinnamomum plants have been traditionally used to treat respiratory viruses, urinary tract infections, relieve abdominal discomfort, improve digestion, act as antidiabetic, analgesic, and neuroprotective agents.\n",
      "Biological Activity: Cinnamomum species exhibit antibacterial, antidiabetic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and neuroprotective activities. These effects are mediated through various mechanisms such as inhibiting bacterial growth, stimulating insulin secretion, scavenging free radicals, reducing inflammation by inhibiting NF-κB, inducing apoptosis in cancer cells, and protecting neurons from oxidative stress.\n",
      "Dose: Doses applied in randomized clinical trials vary between 1 g/day to 6 g/day. For cinnamon oil, the dose varies between 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. Specific doses mentioned include 1.5 g/day for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients and 3 g/day for type 2 diabetic patients.\n",

      "Medicinal Uses: Piperine is used for its antiproliferative, antitumor, antiangiogenesis, antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-obesity, cardioprotective, antimicrobial, anti-aging, and immunomodulatory effects. It is also employed in traditional medicine as an antiseptic, digestion improvement agent, diuretic, antibacterial, and insecticidal compound.\n",
      "Biological Activity: Piperine exhibits numerous pharmacological activities such as antioxidant, antitumor, antihypertensive, anti-asthmatics, analgesic, antipyretic, anti-diarrheal, anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, antispasmodic, hepatoprotective, antidepressant, antibacterial, immunomodulatory, antifungal, antiapoptotic, anti-thyroid, antimutagenic, antimetastatic, and anti-spermatogenic properties. It also inhibits various metabolizing enzymes, boosting cognitive actions and fertility.\n",
      "Dose: The dosage varies depending on the application. For example, piperine was administered at doses ranging from 5 mg/kg to 330 mg/kg body weight in experimental studies.

It has dark-green, hairy, oblong, ovate leaves. The young shoots are preferentially picked for processing into green tea. White tea is produced from very young tea leaves or buds covered with tiny, silvery hairs, harvested only once a year in early spring. Flowers are yellow-white, with 7 to 8 petals. Leaves are 4-15 cm long and 2-5 cm broad, young leaves are light green with short white hairs on the underside.\",\n",
      "  \"Toxicity\": \"High doses of green tea polyphenols can cause hepatotoxicity. Excessive intake may lead to autoxidative reactions, increased ROS production, DNA damage, cardiovascular conditions, cancer, hypothyroidism, and liver toxicity due to the prooxidant property of tea polyphenols. Higher supplementation levels can lead to growth retardation, hematological abnormalities, and organ injuries.\",\n",

The fruit is highly nutritious, containing 3-30% oil, rich in antioxidants, flavonoids, and other bioactive compounds. It supports healthy lipid metabolism, lowers LDL cholesterol, and increases HDL cholesterol. The nutritional indices indicate low polyunsaturated/saturated (PUFA/SFA) ratio (0.45), high atherogenicity index (IA) (4.13), and thrombogenicity index (IT) (9.47). These values suggest limited dietary suitability due to low PUFA content and high SFA levels.

      "  \"Botanic description\": \"Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is a perennial herb belonging to the Asteraceae family. It grows up to 40 cm tall with spatula-like, grooved leaves that conduct rainwater to the root. The plant has a thick taproot averaging 15-30 cm in length, yellow to orange flowers blooming from spring to mid-autumn, and white burls containing seeds dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in temperate climates, often found in turves, near roads, wetlands, and humid soil areas.\",\n",
      "  \"Toxicity\": \"Dandelion has low toxicity with an LD50 value estimated at 36.8 g/kg for the root and 28.8 g/kg for the herb. No tumors were observed in rats fed a diet composed of 32% dandelion rhizomes. Rabbits administered dandelion at doses up to 6 g/kg body weight for seven days did not demonstrate visible toxicity. Heavy metals like lead, cadmium, and nickel can accumulate in dandelion plants, potentially impacting bioavailability of bioactive compounds.\",\n",
      "  \"Adverse reactions\": \"Possible adverse reactions include skin allergy, eczema, increased sun sensitivity, gastrointestinal symptoms such as stomach discomfort, diarrhea, heartburn, parasitic infection due to ingestion of contaminated dandelion, lowering of blood sugar levels, increased risk of bleeding when taken with drugs that increase the risk of bleeding, allergic contact dermatitis, cross-sensitization in patients sensitized to other members of the Asteraceae family.\",\n",
      "  \"Health benefits\": \"Dandelion offers numerous health benefits, including protection against cancer, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, liver damage, improved lipid profiles, enhanced insulin secretion, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, stimulation of growth of bifidobacteria, increased bile secretion, promotion of overall digestive health, antioxidant protection, potential anticancer effects, pain relief, regulation of blood sugar levels, prevention of blood clotting, and promotion of gut health through prebiotic activity.\",\n",
      "  \"Nutritional benefits\": \"Rich in vitamins (A, C, D, E, K, and B), minerals (calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, zinc), fiber, protein, unsaturated fatty acids, trace elements, antioxidants such as chlorophylls, tocopherols, and carotenoids. Enhances nutritional value of eggs when included in hen diets and provides high levels of potassium, beta-carotene, and essential fatty acids.\",\n",

The leaves appear from the soil directly without any stem, are 1.3–2.5 cm in width and around 1 m in length. Cymbopogon citratus forms dense clumps up to 3 m tall with short rhizomes. Leaves are erect, glabrous, more than 1 m long, 5-15 mm wide, with rough margins and membranaceous or arid ligules. Inflorescences are erect, usually in pairs of terminal spiciform racemes 30-60 cm long. Sessile small spikes, canaliculated ventral side, 4.5-5.0 mm long, 0.8-1.0 mm wide, ciliated margins. Perennial herb growing up to 3 m tall with short rhizomes. Leaves are erect, glabrous, more than 1 m long, 5-15 mm wide, with rough margins and membranaceous ligules. Inflorescences are erect, usually in pairs of terminal spiciform racemes. Small sessile spikes with ciliated margins and equal or subequal glumes. Superior glume is lanceolate, usually 1-nerved; sterile lemma is lanceolate, 2-nerved, ciliated. Fertile lemma is linear, bifid, 1-nerved, ciliated. Perennial, tufted, aromatic grass with erect culms (stems) up to 2-3m tall, smooth and glabrous. Leaves are coriaceous, terete, embracing the culm, glabrous, striate, long attenuate at both ends, apex acuminate, drooping, glaucous-green.\",\n",
      "  \"Toxicity\": \"Potential toxicity concerns exist with lemongrass essential oil at high levels of exposure to gustatory or olfactory systems. Methanolic extracts may present some toxicity due to the presence of alkaloids. Aqueous extract of C. citratus showed genotoxic effects on bone marrow cells of Mus musculus L., inducing an increased frequency of micronucleus. Consumption of C. citratus tea should be done with moderation. Compounds like coumarins, tannins, anthraquinone, and saponins contribute to its toxicity, but herbal drugs from the plant are generally safe within acceptable concentration limits. No acute or sub-acute toxicity attributable to oral administration of Cymbopogon citratus essential oil at a dose of 2000 mg/kg. Oral LD50 greater than 2000 mg/kg. LGEO, citral, and geraniol showed cytotoxic effects on human leukocytes and erythrocytes at higher concentrations.\",\n",
